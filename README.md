# Cook-E development team process #

## Software toolset ##

### Mobile application ###

The mobile application will be written in Java and will run on Android. It will support Android versions 4.0 and higher
(API levels 14 and higher). According to Google's statistics, this will make the application compatible with 96% of
Android devices that have recently provided their information to Google.

The development team chose to target Android because it is widely used and some team members have experience developing
Android applications. Java is the primary language used for Android development, and all team members have experience with
it.

### Web service ###

The web service component will use an existing database management system to store information.

Development will be split into three repositories:

* A mobile application repository, for the mobile application and its documentation
* A web repository, for the web service component and its documentation
* A development repository, for project-wide documentation and communication

The project will use the issue tracking and wiki features of each repository for development documentation.
